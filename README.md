# Task-4
Functions

This repository contains an HTML file that integrates two JavaScript files: "arrow.js" and "script.js". The HTML file serves as a basic template for a web page, and the JavaScript files include code for different functionalities.
This JavaScript code includes various functions implemented using arrow functions, anonymous functions and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE). The functions cover a range of tasks, including finding odd numbers, converting elements to uppercase, calculating the sum of numbers, identifying prime numbers, finding palindromes, removing duplicates, rotating arrays, and calculating the median of two arrays.

# File Structure
  1. `index.html` - The main HTML file 
  2.  `script.js` - It contains Javascript code includes function implemented using anonymous functions and Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
  3. `arrow.js` - It contains Javascript code includes function implemented using arrow function

Functions
---------

### Anonymous Functions

1.  **Odd Numbers**
    
    *   Function: `oddnumbers`
    *   Purpose: Identifies odd numbers in an array.
    *   Example: `oddnumbers(array)`
2.  **Uppercase Conversion**
    
    *   Function: `caps`
    *   Purpose: Converts elements of an array to uppercase.
    *   Example: `caps(array1)`
3.  **Sum of Numbers**
    
    *   Function: `sumofnumbers`
    *   Purpose: Calculates the sum of numbers in an array.
    *   Example: `sumofnumbers(array, sum)`
4.  **Prime Numbers**
    
    *   Function: `primenumbers`
    *   Purpose: Identifies prime numbers in an array.
    *   Example: `primenumbers(array)`
5.  **Palindromes**
    
    *   Function: `palindrome`
    *   Purpose: Finds palindromes in an array.
    *   Example: `palindrome(array)`
6.  **Remove Duplicates**
    
    *   Function: `duplicates`
    *   Purpose: Removes duplicate elements from an array.
    *   Example: `duplicates(array)`
7.  **Rotate Array**
    
    *   Function: `rotated`
    *   Purpose: Rotates an array by a specified number of positions.
    *   Example: `rotated(array, k)`
8.  **Median of Two Arrays**
    
    *   Function: `median`
    *   Purpose: Calculates the median of two sorted arrays.
    *   Example: `median(m1, m2)`

### IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

The IIFE versions of the above functions perform the same tasks but are wrapped in immediately invoked functions.
### Arrow Function

The Arrow versions of the above functions perform the same tasks but are wrapped in Arrow functions. In this I have done upto 5 tasks u can try the remaining tasks in it. 

Note
----
* Ensure that the JavaScript files are correctly located in the same directory as the HTML file or adjust the `src` attributes in the `<script>` tags accordingly.
*   Adjust the values of `array`, `k`, `k2`, `array1`, `m1`, and `m2` for testing different scenarios.
